### COFFEEROASTERS SUBSCRIPTION SITE - FRONTEND MENTOR CHALLENGE

This project is a responsive 3-page subscription website for Coffeeroasters, featuring a homepage, about page, and a subscription plan creation page,

## Technologies Used

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,html,css,sass)](https://skillicons.dev)

## What I'm Most Proud Of:

1. Implemented dynamic form logic that handles different coffee subscription scenarios
2. Created a flexible order summary generation that adapts to capsule/ground coffee selections


## Challenges Encountered:

Challenges: 

1. Complex conditional logic for form validation
2. Handling different user paths (capsule vs. ground coffee)
3. Dynamically enabling/disabling form elements

Overcome by:

1. Using switch statements for option tracking
2. Creating helper functions like isOrderSummaryComplete()
3. Implementing conditional rendering based on user selections
